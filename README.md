# Getting And Cleaning Course Project
Getting and Cleaning Course Project

This folder contains the R file that generates the GettingCleaningDataProject.txt.

The code is in a function called itself Run_Analysis.R.
The function accepts an optional parameter to specify the base folder where the UCI HAR Datasets is contained, 
if the folder is in the working directory no parameter needs to be specified.

When launched the procedure generates the file GettingCleaningDataProject.txt.

The repository contains also the text file itself and the codebook.
